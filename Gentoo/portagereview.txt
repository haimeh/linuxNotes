 * Messages for package dev-lang/perl-5.36.0:

 * UPDATE THE PERL MODULES:
 * After updating dev-lang/perl the installed Perl modules
 * have to be re-installed. In most cases, this is done automatically
 * by the package manager, but subsequent steps are still recommended
 * to ensure system consistency.
 *
 * You should start with a depclean to remove any unused perl dependencies
 * that may confuse portage in future. Regular depcleans are also encouraged
 * as part of your regular update cycle, as that will keep perl upgrades working.
 * Recommended: emerge --depclean -va
 *
 * You should then call perl-cleaner to clean up any old files and trigger any
 * remaining rebuilds portage may have missed.
 * Use: perl-cleaner --all

 * Messages for package sys-apps/coreutils-9.1-r1:

 * Messages for package sys-libs/pam-1.5.2-r1:

 * Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
 * warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
 * after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
 * implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
 * restart the software manually after the update.
 *
 * You can get a list of such software running a command like
 *   lsof / | grep -E -i 'del.*libpam\.so'
 *
 * Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

* Messages for package net-misc/dhcpcd-9.4.1:

 *
 * dhcpcd has zeroconf support active by default.
 * This means it will always obtain an IP address even if no
 * DHCP server can be contacted, which will break any existing
 * failover support you may have configured in your net configuration.
 * This behaviour can be controlled with the noipv4ll configuration
 * file option or the -L command line switch.
 * See the dhcpcd and dhcpcd.conf man pages for more details.
 *
 * Dhcpcd has duid enabled by default, and this may cause issues
 * with some dhcp servers. For more information, see
 * https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=477356
 *
 * If you activate the lookup-hostname hook to look up your hostname
 * using the dns, you need to install net-dns/bind-tools.

 * You may add it to the boot runlevel by:

 *
 * Alternatively, you can leave elogind out of any

 * A symlink has been placed in /etc/portage/make.conf.lto that can be used as a basis for these modifications.
 * See README.md for more details.
 * lto-overlay and ltoize are part of a project to help find undefined behaviour in C and C++ programs through the use of aggressive compiler optimizations.
 * One of the aims of this project is also to improve the performance of linux distributions through these mechanisms as well.
 * Occasionally, you will experience breakage due to LTO problems.  These are documented in the README.md of this repository.
 * If you add an override for a particular package, please consider sending a pull request upstream so that other users of this
repository can benefit.
 * You will require a complete system rebuild in order to gain the benefits of LTO system-wide.
 * Please consider reading the README.md at the root of this repository before attempting to rebuild your system to familiarize
yourself with the goals of this project and potential pitfalls you could run into.
 * This is an experimental project and should not be used on a stable system in its current state.
