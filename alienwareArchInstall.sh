# these notes assume uefi mobo and are particular to:
# Alienware m17x r4 
# Alienware 51m
# my machines have much  ram so swap is skipped


#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Partitions
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# first find the drive you wish to mount to
lsblk -f
# or to see partitions another way 
fdisk -l

# next we partition the disk for efi, root, and home
# efi will be EFI system and later formatted vfat (550M)
# root will be Linux root (x86-64) amd formatted ext4 (128G)
# home will be Linux home and formatted ext4 (remainder)
# NOTE you may need to choose gpt as the header thing first
mklabel gpt
# also do it by, to delete old header thing (just run it for a sec):
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvme1n1p1 bs=512
# fun fact, this can also be used to copy a partition
# NOTE I do much dev stuff so my root pertition is bigger

cfdisk /dev/sda
# or maybe if its a new ssd
cfdisk /dev/nvme1n1

# once partitions are written, they must be formatted
# efi
mkfs.msdos -F32 /dev/nvme1n1p1
# root and home
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p3


#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Mount and main Install
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# set mountpoints for each partition
# start with root
# mnt is usually already there
mount /dev/nvme1n1p2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/nvme1n1p3 /mnt/home
mkdir /mnt/efi
mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/efi

# edit to make sure your top mirror is closest (if you want)

# "ip link" to see network interfaces
# wireless starts with w, ethernet with enp or etch
# connect to the internet via wifi: 
vim /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifiName.conf

# now finishing touches
wpa_passphrase wifiName wifiPass >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifiName.conf
wpa_supplicant -B -i wInterface123 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wifiName.conf
# you may need to run dhcpcd after

# connect via ethernet:
dhcpcd enpOReth
# this gets the ip lease and route and whatnot

# now install arch
# base is the only requirement
# I add base-devel vim wireless_tools wpa_supplicant dialog
# the last three are needed for wifi

# now that we have the needed files setup
# we need the mounting of these drives to be fully auto

# >> copies the output to the specified file
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
